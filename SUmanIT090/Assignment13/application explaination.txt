This is a basic CRUD application , i have created a backend in which i have defined register and login endpoints , 
after the login i have defined a complete crud operarion that a user can do to which the changes will also be reflexted in database also.


The frontend contains the pages according to the backend there is a registation page , login page and finally a home page which welcomes the user.


the integration part is not done yet , i will be doing it soon.


 NOTE :- This micro project was just a practice assignment that i did on my own to implement the angular learning held on friday by namya.

 backend file -CRUDapp

the  backend is tested on swagger and works fine.


 frontend file:- appl
  Register pags is at :- http://localhost:4200/register
  Login page is at :- http://localhost:4200/login

i have used components to create the 3 different pages and have interlinked it ,
